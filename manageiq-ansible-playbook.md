# Automate hybrid cloud management using ManageIQ and Ansible

### Description

Since [ManageIQ](http://manageiq.org/) code-name
[Fine](http://manageiq.org/blog/2017/04/Announcing-Fine-Beta-Release/)
release it is possible to automate environment using
[Ansible](http://manageiq.org/docs/reference/latest/doc-Managing_Providers/miq/#ansible-inside))

of this project is to develop automation using Ansible and Ruby to
extend usage of ManageIQ for hybrid cloud management and automation.

### Tasks
1. Develop [Ansible Playbooks](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks.html)
   which can be imported as ansible repositories in ManageIQ.
2. Develop Service dialogs needed to execute playbooks as service
   catalogs([link](http://manageiq.org/docs/get-started/create-service-item))
3. Develop or/and enhance code required for
   [automate](http://manageiq.org/docs/automation)
4. Write documentation which should help others to use those playbooks
   in their environment using(any one):
   * [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/)
   * [Python Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/)
   * [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/about/)
